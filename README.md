```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```

3. **Edit the Collaborators.txt File**: Open the `writename.txt` file in your preferred text editor and add your name to the list.

4. **Save the Changes**: Save the changes to the `writename.txt` file.

5. **Add and Commit Your Changes**: Use the following commands to stage and commit your changes:
```
git add writename.txt
git commit -m "Added my name [Your Name] to the writename.txt file"
